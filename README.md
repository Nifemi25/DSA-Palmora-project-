 This project involved a comprehensive HR data analysis for Palmora Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, to uncover and address gender inequality issues across its three operational regions. 

## Project Topic: Palmora Group HR Analysis 

### Project overview
The analysis was initiated a reputational crisis related to gender disparity. It required cleaning and preprocessing the HR dataset, analyzing gender distribution across departments and regions, evaluating compliance with new salary regulations, visualizing salary distribution in $10,000 bands, Calculating employee bonuses based on performance ratings.

### Tools used 
- Power query editor for data cleaning and transformation 
- Model view ( that shows the relationship between the tables )
- Report view for visualization ( cluster chart, pie chart, doghnut chart, map chart, bar chart, card, slicer etc)

### Steps taken 
- Step 1: Data cleaning
  
  Used power query editor to clean raw data, replaced empty gender with a generic gender status which is  "prefer not to say", removed null under department and salary. Transposed the bonus data and then merged the employee data with the bonus data, replaced the null for those not rated under the rating. Converted data types to appropriate format.
   Applied custom column for the new salary and bonus, created a conditional column for salary band ( 0-10000,10001-20000 etc )

   
 - Step 2: Data Modelling 
  Viewed the table under the model view then connected the both table using the department which has a many to many relationship.

  - Step 3: Data visualiaztion
    Used reprt view for visualiation. Cluster chart, pie chart, doghnut chart, map chart, bar chart, card, slicer was used.
